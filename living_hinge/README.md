Generic Living Hinges
=====================

```HingeMain.scad``` contains the logic for drawing the hinge, it expects a ```LH_Gap``` module to be ```use```d before it is imported.

To Do
-----

* Find a (better) way to use different gap types in the same drawing ([this](http://forum.openscad.org/Passing-parameters-to-children-td4808.html) would seem to work but not sure about correctness)

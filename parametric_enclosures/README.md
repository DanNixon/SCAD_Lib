Parametric Enclosures
=====================

Several parametric enclosures I designed.

When enclosures have been generated the DXFs can be modified to include whatever
mounting holes, etc are needed.

Building
--------

To build the entire set of DXFs for an enclosure: `make` or a single part with
`make [part]`.

DXFs can be removed using `make clean`.

Configuration
-------------

Design configuration is done in an enclosures `config.scad` which contains
documentation on the function of each option.
